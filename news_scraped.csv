These orders, both from government and private sector, were placed on a commercial basis.

While India “appreciate[d] efforts by China to ensure the quality of goods exported”, it also called on Beijing to fulfil previously placed orders with companies that were licensed by Indian authorities to export to the Indian market. China imposed new regulations to tighten checks on April 10, following concerns over quality of exports expressed in several countries.,“In some cases, some of the orders placed recently were placed before regulations came into effect that limited and restricted the number of companies from China that can export to India,” Mr. Misri said. “ Given that the products are licensed for import to India, it will be a welcome step for Chinese authorities to expedite the registration of these products. Our expectation is that these well-established companies will fulfil their contractual obligations.”,Also read |,Coronavirus: ‘Don’t target doctors asking for protective equipment’,Mr. Misri said there were “more than half a dozen” orders in different stages of processing, and India’s current understanding was delivery schedules remained on course. “We have a schedule that stretches from deliveries starting tomorrow [April 15] until the end of the month, when half a dozen consignments ordered by different entities in India will be delivered,” he said. “Our understanding is the registration process has been initiated and we have requested the Chinese government to expedite the registration process of companies so that export orders already processed and ready to ship can be sent on their way to India. We hope this request can be facilitated by the Chinese government.”,There have also been concerns over some orders being diverted. The Tamil Nadu government said this week that 50,000 testing kits it had ordered from China were diverted to the U.S. “We have seen media reports but not come across authoritative reports of supplies intended for India having been diverted,” Mr. Misri said.,Mr. Misri said maintaining open supply-chains and agreed timelines of orders would be “the best possible signal to send” about the state of the India-China relationship. He cited the example of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), which India imports in large quantities from China, and some Chinese companies also source from India.,The Indian Ambassador said there was “considerable space for India and China to cooperate” in dealing with COVID-19, from both the short-term and long-term perspective. “The immediate aspect is for us to cooperate in procurement of much needed medical equipment and products in India as our healthcare community on the frontlines of this challenge battles this outbreak. When China was at the height of dealing with this outbreak, we had offered and provided medical assistance. Now we are in the process of commercially procuring a large number of these supplies. China happens to be one of the largest producers of a number of these products.”,“We are identifying bonafide suppliers and entering into agreements,” he said. “What is important is quality material continues to be available at reasonable and stable prices, and we are able to establish or re-establish freight and cargo lines disrupted by the initial impact of the crisis.”,There was also scope for working together when it came to research on COVID-19, Mr. Misri said, noting that various Indian agencies had already taken part in video conferencing calls with the Chinese government in sharing experiences in tackling the pandemic.,India and China are marking the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 2020 and had planned 70 events to be held. “We might not be able to undertake every activity,” Mr. Misri said, “but it remains our intention to do as much as is possible in the time that is available and in as befitting a manner as possible.”",Coronavirus | India to get 15 million PPE kits from China

Pool testing reduces the number of test kits used, and therefore, increases testing capacity.,Asked about former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s assertion on ramping up testing, Mr. Deo said it has to be the way forward because if one is not testing aggressively then it is like being in a “dark room” and working on speculation.,He said different protocols are being followed around the world and while one advocated a lockout, the other was testing and regulating movement.,Also read:,Coronavirus | Amit Shah intervention made ICMR expand labs for testing COVID-19,“Between South Korea and India, South Korea has tested about 7,000 per million, while India, I don’t think it would have touched even 200 per million, so that is the gap....It is easier not to have a lockdown if you have a more aggressive testing protocol.

But not elsewhere barring Bengaluru where we are seeing substantial growth in demand,” he added.,He said the company is getting a very strong connection with neighbourhood stores who are catering to consumers particularly in the North and in the West.

We worked hard to turn every challenge into an opportunity. As soon as alarm about the coronavirus was sounded, our government started taking some rapid measures.,In the first week of March, on the call of Hon'ble Prime Minister, we started the proceedings for prevention of corona. Special programmes for training of physicians, paramedical and nursing staff etc. were ensured. The Panchayati Raj, Rural Development and Urban Development Departments were directed to conduct comprehensive awareness programmes. We formed 11 committees. For the citizens of Uttar Pradesh residing in other States, 32 nodal officers were deployed (16 IAS, 16 IPS).

With this, Uttar Pradesh is the first State to do pool testing.,We are manufacturing PPE kits, masks, and sanitizers in Uttar Pradesh. This is the reason that the situation in Uttar Pradesh is very much under control today. Our 27 districts are already corona free, including Pilibhit which is now free from corona. Two cases were found there but today there is not a single case of corona there.

These teams surveyed about 9.3 lakh people from house-to-house and screened 1.65 lakh homes.

If people from outside do not want to return, they can work in their respective districts under the One District One Product (ODOP) programme or they can be absorbed in the industries coming in to Uttar Pradesh.,See, I have repeatedly said that in Uttar Pradesh, we will not let anyone break the law.

Airlines themselves have said bookings during this short period were minuscule, which means this will benefit only a small number of passengers. By restricting its order to these dates, the government has essentially allowed airlines to deny passengers refunds for tickets booked before March 25, though it is a violation of the DGCA’s rules.,The Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR) states, “The option of holding the refund amount in credit shell by the airlines shall be the prerogative of the passenger and not a default practice of the airline.”,The government directive is flawed on several counts, including allowing the airlines 30 days after receiving a passenger’s request for a refund, when the CAR requires the airlines to refund on the same day in case of a cash transaction and seven days for credit card purchases. Only if a passenger booked a ticket on a travel portal could the airlines take 30 days. Moreover, there is no need for a passenger to request a refund because it is the duty of the airlines to start the process immediately after a flight cancellation.,Aviation consultancy CAPA posted on Twitter on Friday: “The circular should clearly state that the DGCA is temporarily suspending — with the period of time to be defined — the provisions of the Civil Aviation Requirement on the refund of airline tickets (dated 22-May-2008), as well as the Passenger Charter of 2019. If these rights have been suspended due to emergency conditions prevailing, this should be formally notified by the DGCA.”,Asked whether the government was likely to amend the CAR or suspend it temporarily to ensure that its order complied with the rules, a senior official said, “The CAR is for normal circumstances. What we are dealing with is an extraordinary situation. There is no need to issue an amendment.

"April 19, 2020 00:02 IST",,"The story so far:,It has been over three weeks since Prime Minister,Narendra Modi announced the world’s biggest lockdown,, in India, to fight,COVID-19,, the pandemic that has claimed over 1.5 lakh lives worldwide. Epidemiologists have said that the impact of the lockdown in slowing down infections would take,at least three weeks to show,. This is because the incubation period of the virus could extend to two weeks and any residual sources of imported infections, from before airports were sealed, would at most show up in a week.,The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11 but until March 13, India’s official position was that it “wasn’t a health emergency and there was no need to panic”. India, with 81 cases, was evacuating Indians from abroad and had restricted international entry through only 19 of its 37 land immigration checkposts. By March 15, it was evident to health experts and epidemiologists that the virus, SARS-CoV-2, has properties that distinguishes itself from other coronaviruses and even influenza viruses. It is highly transmittable and can evade the immune system for longer and therefore spreads quickly even without the infected being visibly sick. The virus is able to penetrate deeper into the lower airways. Therefore, to the elderly and the aged, those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, it poses a heightened risk of acute pneumonia.,Coronavirus,|,Post-lockdown, India’s infection growth rate has slowed down, says Ministry,On March 24, Mr. Modi said: “I fold my hands to say — please stay where you are,” adding that “all leading experts say 21 days is the minimum we require to break the coronavirus transmission cycle. If we are not able to handle these 21 days, the country and your family will go back 21years and many families will be destroyed. I am saying this not as the Prime Minister but as your family member.” The night of his address, India recorded 536 cases — a six-fold jump in less than two weeks; there were 10 deaths. Government and health officials feel that a complete lockdown and cessation of travel will keep those who are infected isolated and restrict infections to contained clusters. This would avoid community transmission when it becomes impossible to trace the source of infections and quarantining is of no use. Such a situation would quickly overwhelm hospitals as seen in Italy, Spain, Iran and the United States. With among the lowest capita availability of hospital beds and health-care workers, health experts say if there are too many cases, it will be catastrophic for India.,The lockdown has coincided with an increase in testing and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has widened the pool of people of suspected cases who need to get tested. Earlier, only those with a travel history and displaying symptoms were being tested. Now, even those who show flu-like illnesses and are in a hotspot are likely to be tested and quarantined. Since the lockdown,,confirmed cases have risen 23 times,to around 14,000; deaths too have risen 40 times.,Coronavirus,,|,,Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India,Every weekly rise in cases has seen an increase by a factor of 3.7, 2.5 and 2.0, respectively, until April 16. Testing grew in those same weeks by a factor of 2.4, 2.1 and 1.1 times, respectively. A slower growth in testing thus appears to be corresponding to a slower rise in confirmed cases.,Increased testing does not necessarily mean a rise in cases, and could be explained by a fall in the speed of disease transmission. However, to conclude so would be premature, caution health officials. That is because India has still tested only a limited proportion of its population. There is a pool, and we do not know how large, of asymptomatic people, that is those who have been infected but do not show symptoms, but can infect others. Testing must be increased and contacts traced so that asymptomatics are also under the radar. Only this week India has effectively unveiled a new set of strategies — the use of rapid antibody tests and the concept of pooled testing to estimate the extent of undetected infections in hotspots which are places with a large number or large increase in cases. These are useful but relatively crude measures and can still lead to several asymptomatic people going undetected, according to health officials.,Coronavirus,|,Revised testing norms likely as number of cases continues to rise,While India’s lockdown has been among the harshest in the world, there have been several instances of people gathering in large numbers. In fact, the makeshift relief camps that States have set up for migrant labour, the high average density of population are all aggravating factors for the spread of clusters as is seen in Mumbai.,Finally, India’s high,dependence on imported testing kits,and the chemicals needed to analyse them means that testing cannot be equally ramped up across the country. The ICMR has said that it has enough testing kits “for the next eight weeks” but this does not account for the variable testing capacity of various States. The,extension of the lockdown for another three weeks,, until May 3, may buy time but the government needs to clarify its goals. Does it expect the number of hotspot districts of which there are 170 as of this week to come down? Is it to bring down the number of infections by a particular percentage or is it to achieve a more manageable doubling time? This refers to the time it takes for cases to double, which has increased from four days in the last week of March to seven days as of this week. The longer this stretch is, the more time hospitals will have to treat and release COVID-19 patients, refurbish and safely dedicate manpower for clinical management.,Post-April 6, India has seen at least 25 deaths a day, or about 1-2% of the confirmed cases. While this proportion is in line with global trends, they are likely reflective of cases that were confirmed in one to two weeks weeks before the lockdown.,On the other hand, from April 3 the recovery rate of those confirmed has increased from 70% on April 3 to 80% on April 17, which also corresponds to a dip in the death rate. In all, 80% of those infected in India are believed to be below 60.,New cases in Kerala, on a daily count, have dropped to single digits; the number of recoveries exceeds those being hospitalised in Tamil Nadu. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are also showing signs of a dip. These are signs that these States have been able to manage infections effectively through stringent contact tracing and curtailing asymptomatic persons from spreading infection. They also reflect the importance of having moved early to stymie the spread.,Data,|,Kerala flattens the coronavirus curve but must remain vigilant as 'import' cases still dominate,However, a region is said to have stabilised only if no fresh cases are reported for 28 days — and no State is close to that scenario yet. The rise in infections is also due to the disproportionate influence of clusters. Mumbai and Delhi show that even with high rates of testing, infections will keep rising if quarantining and contact tracing are not effective. Indore in Madhya Pradesh shows that laxity in enforcing quarantine and testing last month could have seeded several clusters that will be difficult to contain. Moreover, the demands that a total lockdown make on the economy and the extent to which it suppresses normal life can mean that a staggered relaxation of the lockdown is likely. But health officials warn that this may lead to infected people travelling to new places. India may have to continue dealing with frequent outbreaks for a while, they feel, rather than expect to decisively stamp out the disease during an extended lockdown.",

If approvals come through, about 20,000 kits could be made by the month-end, said Asha Kishore, director, SCTIMST.,Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted: “Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Tech, Trivandrum, an Institute of National Importance, of the @IndiaDST, has developed a diagnostic test kit that can confirm #COVID19 in 2 hours at a low cost.”,Though qualified by the National Institute of Virology’s sister organisation — NIV Alappuzha — as fit to be offered as a diagnostic, the kit awaits formal approval by the Indian Council for Medical Research and its manufacturers, and a licence from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation.,Rapid-Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests are considered the gold standard for detecting the virus. It involves extracting RNA from a swab, collected from the throat or nose, converting it into DNA, magnifying the quantity of DNA and using chemical probes to bind target genes that distinguish SARS-CoV2 from other viruses. While it takes two hours to extract RNA from a given batch of samples, the analysis can take two-and-a-half hours to detect the presence (or absence) of virus in a given batch.,By employing its in-house technology called reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP), it zooms in on regions of the virus’ nucleocaspid (N) gene and can analyse a batch in 10 minutes.,Most RT-PCR kits focus on two different genes, the E (envelope) gene and the RdRP (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) gene. The WHO recommends a E and RdRP test, while the U.S.’s Centres for Disease Control requires an N Gene test. “The N-Gene test is a confirmatory test and widely employed in Germany and China among other countries. However, the design of it is complicated and can be expensive. However, we’ve managed to develop it satisfactorily while keeping costs low,” said Dr. Kishore.

A riot in which the minorities suffered the maximum damage, both in terms of lives and livelihoods, has now become a pretext for the Delhi Police to further witch-hunt activists, most of whom also come from the minority community,” says the statement.,According to the statement, making several people travel to police stations every day and then throwing some of them to jail defeats the very purpose of the lockdown and makes a mockery of social distancing. This at a time when various governments are releasing under-trials from jail to relieve the pressure from the prisons and restrict chances of contamination.,It goes on to state that the lockdown cannot be a lockdown of the rights of citizens, and must not be abused by the authorities. Calling the actions of the Delhi Police utterly inhuman and undemocratic, it underlines that in a democratic country like India, the Constitution gives the people the right to protest and express their views against the government and its policies. “Many people in the country and the world had condemned the draconian Citizenship Amendment Act. Our opposition to the CAA continues, as we see it as a bigoted law that strikes at the secular fabric of our country.

In an exclusive interview to,The Hindu,, the author of the report and Chief Economist for South Asia Hans Timmer says managing migrant returns, service sector revenue losses and ensuring food security for the poorest are major priorities for the region.,Also read:,Coronavirus | World Bank approves $1 billion emergency funds for India to tackle pandemic,This forecast already includes many adverse impacts. The upper and lower bounds are based on two scenarios for advanced economies: one with a two-months lockdown of advanced economies, the other with a four-months lockdown of these economies. These,scenarios translate for South Asia into sharp declines in exports,, disruptions in global value chains, deterioration of investment sentiment, reversal of capital flows, and reduced remittances. Our upper and lower bound forecasts also assume sharp declines in domestic hospitality services. But the drop in growth can indeed be bigger. In the report we mention that we calculated what we call a “worst case scenario”, in which we assume a prolonged lockdown of South Asia economies: an extended lockdown for three months and a more partial lockdown in subsequent quarters. In that case, we ended up with negative growth for the region, a contraction of 1%.,Also read:,World Bank increases coronavirus response fund to $14 Billion,I have been impressed by the reaction of the,India government and other governments in South Asia,. With limited health-care capacity, it is important to contain, or at least mitigate, the spread of COVID-19. But, with a high population density, this is a difficult task. Containment of the pandemic is especially challenging among slum dwellers, domestic migrant workers and refugees. An additional complication is that the lockdown deprives the most vulnerable people of their income. The conclusion is that the lockdown is necessary, but not sufficient. It has to be complemented with food distribution, temporary work programmes and a system of testing and tracing, which is needed to reopen the economy. The temporary work programme could focus on food delivery, production of protective equipment, disinfection of public spaces and on the testing and tracing system. It is commendable that the Indian government is rolling out a tracing system now.,Also read:,Coronavirus | Pandemic may cause Africa’s 1st recession in 25 years: World Bank,It is likely that migrant workers, especially in the Gulf countries, will return home, even if many are still stuck abroad at the moment.

Excerpts.,Are you satisfied with the Bihar government’s efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the State?,The basic thing to fight against COVID-19 should be saving human lives as well as livelihoods. Bihar government appears far behind it as of today. Testing is among the lowest in the country with dilapidated medical infrastructure and there is absolutely no income support programme for the poor and working class.,Do you think number of COVID-19 positive cases in the State is very low and there should be more rapid tests to detect those infected?,Yes, absolutely. The numbers of positive cases are lower only because of conservatively low testing. With dense population of 12.3 crore, the risk of virus’s spread is very high in Bihar. Asymptomatic cases are surging and rapid testing will help in gauging the spread of contagion and breaking the transmission chain. Besides, all health experts have put focus on testing and more testing to defeat this invisible enemy.,Is it true that with its little health and medical facilities, the Bihar government feels helpless in detecting more COVID-19 positive cases?,I think, the real problem is lack of intent in the leadership. Should the government surrender just because it doesn’t have required ammunition? If a small and young State like Chhattisgarh can erect makeshift hospitals in record breaking time, why can’t Bihar? Had the government been proactively strategising in this lockdown buffer of almost 60 days, a lot could have been achieved at the medical infrastructure front.,But the Chief Minister has been holding marathon meetings with top officials to monitor the situation in the State...,What is the end result of these marathon meetings? The question remains why the Chief Minister remained incommunicado. Whilst other CMs are on the ground and briefing their people on a daily basis, Nitishji chose to speak after 18 days. The communication should transcend beyond the coterie too.,Do you think it helps poor people whom the government claims to have paid ₹,1000 in their bank account?,Even a family of three persons can’t live for more than three days with ₹1000 during the lockdown. Everything is so costly. The government should ensure free ration and more cash incentives on a weekly basis with more transparency until the lockdown ceases. Every day we have been interacting with thousands migrants. Even this cash hasn’t been disbursed to 40-50% of the intended beneficiaries.,The government says about 1.8 lakh migrants have returned to the state yet? Do you subscribe this figure or it is much more than this?,From where and how did the govt. mine this? Did govt. facilitate their return? No, it didn’t, isn’t it? Has govt. screened, tested and quarantined 1.8 lakh migrants? There are more than a million stranded outside the State, desperately wanting to come back home. Why has the govt. abandoned them? The majority of them haven’t even been quarantined leave alone being tested. The government figures are few thousands who have been quarantined so far. There is huge gap between govt. claims. Media has reported how pathetic the conditions of quarantine and isolation centres are.,None from poor migrants who have returned from other States has yet tested positive COVID-19 positive? What’s your take on it?,It’s really unfortunate that poor migrants who have nothing to do with the virus are forced to bear the burden. The origin of this disease has been traced to people who travelled outside the country, contracted and brought it here. But you see rich and affluent people are given luxury treatment while our poor brothers and sisters are going through chaos and have devastating effects on their lives.,Unlike the U.P. government, the Bihar Chief Minister has refused to allow students from the State studying in Kota in Rajasthan to return...,The Bihar govt. has double standards and discriminatory policies on issue of Kota students. They give permission to bring back children of high and mighty like they issued pass to a State BJP MLA to bring back his ward but is not ready to bring children of common people. The government should compassionately consider bringing these students as well as the poor migrant labourers back home without any preferential treatment. However, they should be mandatorily screened, tested & quarantined.,You supported U.P. CM Yogi Adityanath’s move to bring back students from Kota but Bihar BJP leaders didn’t make any comment on it? Why?,U.P. CM sent buses to bring back people from his State stranded in Delhi NCR & Kota which ideally every government should be doing. I think BJP leaders from Bihar are tailgating Nitishji for the sake of power and hence the compulsive silence,JD(U) leaders have criticised you for being you’re out of State at this difficult time and say that you only do politics through social media?,Did anyone in the country know there will be total lockdown on March 24? Do you expect JD(U) leaders will praise me and my party for helping stranded migrants across the country with food, ration and money with help of local authorities, govts, our State units and personal contacts? No one can deny that being in opposition with limited resources, better team coordination, management and execution we have performed better than mighty resourceful Bihar govt. So they are defensive . And is it a crime to digitally help people using WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Smartphones, Helpline Numbers, Paytms and UPI? Every CM, CMO or even PM & PMO are using social media to alert, aware and assist their citizens. Bihar CM is a bygone orthodox person who doesn’t know how to use Social media so since beginning he and his party has a negative outlook about it.,Why are you not on the ground and looking after what is going on in the State?,Even before lockdown, Bihar govt. had cancelled my social programmes and didn’t give permission for meetings & gatherings. The government even cancelled our closed door meetings on March 14 & 15. They cancelled my scheduled movements on March 19 & 21. We have a huge mass support base and people know we are pro-poor party. If I move out govt. will accuse me of violating lockdown norms as there will be stampede sort of situation, expecting relief materials. Now let me ask, has the Chief Minister who has been entrusted with the job of governing the State walked out of his bungalow since March 18? Has he visited any hospital or hotspots for that matter?,This pandemic is also going to hit the farmers of the state in a big way?,The government should compensate the losses incurred by them, increase the MSP by 50% and waive off their bills and loan. It should roll out an exclusive stimulus package for farmers and migrant workers.","Coronavirus | Bihar is lagging behind, says Tejashwi Yadav"

"April 15, 2020 18:10 IST",,"Professor Shyam Sundar is an eminent Labour Economist teaching at the Xavier Labour Relations Institute (now called Xavier Institute of Management, Jamshedpur) and is on the Editorial Board of the,Indian Journal of Labour Economics,. In an e-mail interview, he speaks in detail about the impact of the,COVID-19,lockdown and on migrant and organised labour.....,How do you see this extended lockdown affecting labourers across the country considering the majority of them hail from the unorganised sector?,A. T,he national lockdown now is potentially for 40 days,and this means loss of income for more than a month for 400 millions of informal workers which according to the ILO will push them into deeper recesses of poverty. The informal workers are reported to be not able to avail even the additional free foodgrains and pulse since they do not have necessary documents such as the ration card.,On the other hand, contract and other precarious workers employed in the so-called organised sector do not have KYC completed and portable EPF account and hence are not able to get the EPF subvention benefits nor are they able to make withdrawals from their EPF which given their low and uncertain incomes will anyway be lower. The MSME establishments have closed down and due to absence of liquidity/revenue even the well-meaning employers are unable to pay wages to their workers.,The issue of employment security will be a limited privilege to the labour aristocrats, i.e. permanent and skilled workers and unemployment will be much higher than around 24% estimated by the CMIE. The absence of decent income flow, inaccessibility of foodgrains, etc., and absence of any social protection mean starvation and livelihood threats for these millions of unorganised workers. Thus, the potential 40-days of lockdown will mean intensification of vulnerabilities to these workers. The lower MNREGA wage and limited availability of work under this scheme is not providing enough relief to them in the rural sector, though exempting farming activity will provide some relief. These hardships will intensify considerably due to the extension of the lockdown.,Also read|,Lockdown guidelines: What is allowed and what is not allowed after April 20?,The Central government has not so far announced any credible and comprehensive relief measures to the poor and the informal workers and there are media and field reports which show that even the notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) dated March 29 is not widely implemented. Now the notification of the MCA dated April 10 which is purely connected with linking wage payment with the CSR expenditure is being conveniently interpreted by many that employers are not required to pay wages. Thus, there will be legal battles on the existential issue of payment of wages during this extraordinary time of COVID-19.,What steps can be undertaken, within the lockdown period itself, to take care of migrant labour?,It is reported that migrant workers ranging from thousands to millions in several industrialised States have been stranded and started their exodus in several States which has been quickly arrested. The following measures should be quickly implemented: One, in each State a multi-partite special taskforce or a Board should be constituted which should include representatives of trade unions, the NGOs, relevant Departments like Labour, Women and Welfare, etc. to take stock of stranded migrant workers, constitute more relief/settlement centres, to allocate these workers to these centres, ensure compliance of basic needs (like shelter, food, clothing, etc.), provide psychological counselling to address their mental/emotional travails and concerns, among others.,Also read:,Coronavirus | Centre files report on migrant workers,Two, establish helplines through social media, FM and other radio channels, etc. to connect with the unidentified migrant workers. Three, empower the tashildars to issue temporary ration cards valid for 2-3 months to help these workers and their families avail themselves of ration supplies which will decongest relief/settlement centres. Four, several State governments like Jharkhand are sending varying amounts — ₹1,000 or so — to their respective workers and information regarding the origin States of migrant workers could be built. Five, most importantly, they should be tested if they have travelled and/or living in congested places. Six, if the migrant workers are construction workers which probabilities are higher, then, their welfare can be taken care of from the Construction Cess Fund. Six, the orders of the Supreme Court and High Courts (Bombay and Karnataka for example) should be strictly implemented.,Many migrant labourers have moved back to their native places after the announcement or just before, of the lockdown. Employers are worried about the absent labour. What is the way out once the lockdown ends?,The share of migrant workers that have returned due to national lockdown is not significantly high enough to warrant thinking about this issue as the Central and the State governments have successfully arrested the exodus. However, there is a possibility that in the short run due to the COVID-19 impact the absence might be somewhat intense and the mobility-issues long-distance migration might temporarily be operative which will slow down return migration to previous work and geo spaces. However, the market forces obtaining in the rural sector due to restricted demand arising out of economic losses incurred during COVID-19 (difficulties related to harvesting of rabi crops and marketing issues) which mean limited liquidity for employment in future and hence the demand for labour will be relatively much less than in the past.,The MGNREGA offers limited support due to poor implementation issues reflected in pending arrears, low average of days of work (45-50 days in a year) offered during a year, lower NREGA wages, etc. may temporarily offer cushion to the migrant workers; even an optimised implementation of this scheme means 100 days of work. If long-distance migration is weakened, then there could be changes in the geographical composition of migrant workers in the sense that “neighbourhood migration” might replace “long distance and indiscriminate migration” as a solution which if succeeds could change long term migration effects.,Also read: Coronavirus | MGNREGA jobs crash to 1% of normal,The COVID-19 effects will be felt in the legal and institutional reforms concerning workplaces and this will strengthen the incentive for the migrant workers to move out to other States if not old States. The much stronger political measures like regional parties’ violence inflicted on the migrant workers and reservation of jobs for locals have not discouraged inter-State migration because of the under-supply of locals to several low-waged unskilled tasks and the lower reservation wage of the migrants.,Post-lockdown, the market wage is likely to be revised downwards till recovery and then revival phases which are going to take some time and hence the naturally migrant workers who are used to under-bidding and with low reservation wage (the wage at which workers are willing to supply labour) will be even more needed. Adverse political and economic measures like job reservation for locals, violence targeting some types of migrants have not historically discouraged inter-State migration and COVID-19 is less likely to impact adversely. But what will surely happen is the strengthening of legal and institutional frameworks concerning them including portable ration cards and EPF accounts, etc.,Some States (like Rajasthan ) have pushed labour laws that allow 12 hour shifts in essential industries to deal with social distancing measures. How do you view these measures?,The 12-hour shift is based on two assumptions which may not be valid ones. One, in a factory all workers are capable of doing different tasks and hence skills are substitutable; as a result instead of say 100 workers, a factory could employ say two-thirds of the total workers and this will also satisfy social distancing and health security principles. Two, it is kind of inversion of lump of labour fallacy which holds that there exists a given number of hours of work which could be redistributed to create more or fewer jobs.,The 12-hour work arrangement could have some adverse implications. One, if workers are not circulated across a pay period so that all workers enjoy equitable or equal opportunities getting work in a factory, this measure will introduce inequalities in income. Two, though workers will be eligible to get overtime wages which will maximise their incomes, the longer hours of work will adversely affect work-life balance, increase fatigue and in a sense could pose threats for occupational safety and health also.,Three, employers could be incentivised to employ non-regular workers to reduce cost-to-company (CTC) and in that sense contract and trainee workers might be preferred which could cause unrest. Four, the work arrangement will most likely affect incomes of women employees as they need to balance work and family time; further their families may not prefer to send them to the factories due to genuine and/or perceived insecurities in these times. Five, the onus of providing transportation will fall on the factories as public transport system is still under prohibition, which all firms may not have — though the government and industry could solve these logistical issues. But safe transport especially for women employees will be an important concern.,Finally, not only women may be discriminated against, there could be other forms of discrimination like physically differently abled workers’ employment chances will be limited. Having said these, social dialogue, i.e. trade unions and the management should discuss these issues and sort them out cordially. Hence the ILO also stresses the role and importance of social dialogue in these extraordinary contexts.,How can one use this as an opportunity to organisethe hitherto unorganised labour?,If there is any powerful lesson from this entire dreadful COVID-19 context it is that unorganised labourers need two kinds of cover, viz. union organisation cover and legal cover. Had the mainstream trade unions organised the precarious workers such as daily-wage earners, contract workers, migrant workers in highly labour-intensive sectors like construction, then trade unions would not only have been powerful but also proved highly useful in the extraordinary crisis times such as these to partner the government in providing relief to them.,In a sense the “market” for unionism is quite high in India as 85-90% of the 470 million workers are not organised by any trade union. Mainstream trade unions will have to adopt unconventional organising strategies and adopt sector-specific employment relations strategies to organise the workers, though some work has already begun in this direction and hence India has witnessed rising unionisation unlike in the Western countries.,Trade unions have begun to organise the employees in the IT industry, platform economy and other emerging sectors which are also unorganised as conventional industries and occupations such as construction, domestic workers are unorganised. Trade unions need to build bridges with civil society organisations (CSOs) who organise unorganised workers even in the so-called organised industries like garment and also with the CSOs who are engaged with issues concerning environment (green activists).,On the other hand, trade unions need to work hard and persistently to ensure large scale registrations of unorganised workers under the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008 and utterly pressurise the government to issue smart portable electronic chip-based registration-cum-identification cards as envisaged in the said Act. Direct benefit transfer (DBT) to these millions of workers would have been easier. Trade unions need to employ not merely organising strategies but also use legal battles in the courts, lobbying with the government, network with like-minded organisations and become as encompassing as possible. If the union coverage is larger then trade unions could not have been ignored by the government in the design and delivery of relief measures.","Coronavirus lockdown | Unorganised labourers need two kinds of cover: union organisation and legal, says labour expert"

In the current exceptional circumstances, the need for policy action is urgent,” Mr. Gasper said when asked about India’s fiscal strength and the impact of the COVID-19 on its economy.,“The economic toll from the pandemic is likely to be large. We estimate that growth in the fiscal year 2020/21 will be reduced to 1.9%, reflecting both the domestic,COVID-19 impact,from the unprecedented,national lockdown,and weak external demand, he said.,In the face of the pandemic, which is likely to have devastating human and economic consequences, there is an urgent need for government action, including prioritising spending on health care, providing income support to those most vulnerable, and supporting micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), he said, on COVID-19.,,Coronavirus | Congress calls for partial opening of economy,“The measures taken to date — such as the provision of food and cooking gas to vulnerable households, as well as cash transfers to poorer households — go in the right direction and are a good start, Mr. Gasper said.,The Finance Ministry unveiled a,₹1.70 lakh crore economic package,on March 26 involving free foodgrain and cooking gas for the poor for the next three months.,“To be candid, we see scope for additional spending in these areas, beyond what has already been announced, as well as a need to enact policies which support MSMEs who have been hit by the (appropriate) social distancing measures and nationwide lockdown, he added.,According to Mr. Gasper, in India, large, timely and targeted fiscal and financial sector measures are essential to shield vulnerable households and firms.,“The fiscal stimulus package is one step in the right direction. The package has appropriately included in-kind (food; cooking gas) and cash transfers to lower-income households; insurance coverage for workers in the healthcare sector; and wage support to low-wage workers, he said.,Similarly, a three-month moratorium was allowed for all term loans for banks and non-bank financial companies, as well as interest deferral for working capital loans, he said.,When asked about the specific measure India could take to save the economy, he said the IMF believes measures could be taken on fiscal, monetary and financial sector policies in the near term.,On fiscal policy, additional support is needed in the near term, including on health care and for small and medium-sized firms and vulnerable households, beyond the fiscal stimulus measures already announced, he said.,Over the medium term, though, substantial new measures will be needed to bring the deficit and debt back towards the Central government’s medium-term targets (deficit of three per cent and debt of 40% as a share of GDP), he added.,Monetary policy, he asserted, should maintain a strong easing bias to mitigate any sharp COVID-19-related slowdown and support the recovery, given the sharp slowdown in domestic and global activities, moderating inflation amid a wide negative output gap, and lower commodity prices.,Mr. Gasper said financial sector stress prior to COVID-19 constrained monetary transmission needs to be closely monitored.,Despite measures to improve liquidity conditions, including through temporary and partial guarantees, funding pressures persist, with implications for the recovery once the shock dissipates.,Exchange rate flexibility should continue to play the role of a shock absorber, while avoiding excessive volatilities, he said.,Experience from the COVID-19 pandemic shows that monitoring and containment costs are much lower than those of mitigation and treatment, he noted.,As such, it is very important to prevent the health systems from becoming overloaded. National governments should continue to allocate sufficient funds for sub-national governments to spend on health services or mobilise medical resources, Mr. Gasper said.,He said based on the experience from other countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, India’s proactive decision to pursue the nationwide lockdown for three weeks is an important step to contain the disease and save lives.,Stating that the support for health systems, including higher spending is needed, the IMF official noted that it is crucial to prioritise health spending for medical equipment and COVID testing; compensate doctors and nurses appropriately; and make sure that hospitals and makeshift clinics have enough personal protective equipment and resources to function effectively.,Emergency lifelines should be targeted to households to maintain basic needs and viable firms to prevent layoffs and exits from supply chains.,They should be made progressive to ensure that lower-income households benefit more.

Edited excerpts from an exclusive interview with,The Hindu’s,Sandeep Phukan,.,In the State [of West Bengal], lockdown enforcement is critically compromised and as per ground reality, it is about 70%. The Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) communication reflected on the dilution of lockdown, religious gatherings under the very nose of the administration, and compromising social distancing in markets. It reflects the ground reality. I have urged the Chief Minister to hold officials accountable.,Also read:,Coronavirus | West Bengal pulled up for lockdown violations,For reasons I cannot figure out and in defiance of Constitutional prescriptions, she [West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee] continues to be in ‘lockdown mode’ with the Governor. This incommunicado stance cannot be countenanced constitutionally. Looking at the sensitivity of the situation and the need for togetherness in fighting against COVID-19, I am yielding to expediency and overlooking this grave lapse.,Lockdown has no severe execution. To be effective, social distancing has to be 100% and anything less than that can have disastrous impact. The cascading impact of the Nizamuddin episode is an eye-opener.,The CM is projecting only her political face all through. I have urged her to disable her political antenna, avoid focus on vote bank politicking and act in concert with the Central government’s take on the corona pandemic. Lockdown enforcement unfortunately has a political angle and religious congregations are tacitly allowed.,The entire public distribution system has been hijacked by ruling party workers. Free ration given by the Central government has been virtually handed over to political wings of the ruling party. Free ration is distributed not by officials but by the TMC (Trinamool Congress) workers to their liking. This is outrageous disregard for the law.,The testing and sharing of information are a cause for serious concern. Very low level of testing is being done. Information as regards COVID-19 deaths is controlled.,In the first week of April, there were no bulletins for three days in a row. The enormity of the situation can be gauged from the fact that at one time, an Expert Committee held the number of deaths as seven but within minutes, the Chief Secretary brought it down to three by addressing another press conference. There is no confidence in the information being fed by the State. The situation is alarming.,Six hospitals in Kolkata and Howrah are shut as doctors and patients tested positive for the coronavirus. Over 300 health warriors in these hospitals are quarantined. According to the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), there are adequate number of testing kits. Unfortunately, available kits are not being used and testing in adequate numbers is not taking place.,ICMR NICED is best equipped but adequate samples for testing were not being given to them. Only because it is a Central body. This is grave lapse and we cannot play like this with the lives and welfare of the people.,I am never on charges. I only indicate the ground reality which is available to me on account of my very extensive interaction. The people have a deep sense of worry and concern. They have taken the Home Ministry’s communication as a timely warning. They are relieved by the concern shown by the Centre. As regard my input to the Union Home Ministry, I don’t discuss that in the media.,First, can anyone act without any input? There has been none so far. I can say that there is not even a semblance of regard to the Constitution by her [Ms. Banerjee]. This is most undemocratic. My cooperation to the State, be it with regard to legislation or otherwise, has been exemplary. There is no delay at my end.,Also read:,West Bengal to ask parents to collect mid-day meal supplies from schools,Centre-bashing is there daily by the Chief Minister. And a result of the confrontation with the Centre is that our 70 lakh farmers have already lost over [₹]5,000 crore in KISAN SAMMAN, health infrastructure is failing to cope because the State missed an opportunity to benefit from Ayushman Bharat. Why stake public welfare because of politics? This is not people-friendly governance.,I am acting as per my oath under Article 159 of the the Constitution that I will protect the Constitution and serve the people of the State. Her [Ms. Banerjee] being incommunicado is indicative of the failure of the Constitutional mechanism in the State. In this crisis period, I tried reaching out so that we can work in unison, shoulder to shoulder. From my tweets, you will get ample feeling of my desire to secure her cooperation. She is obligated to brief me.,Neither the State nor anyone has pointed out that I have ever crossed a Constitutional ‘Lakshman,rekha,’. I do not believe in a confrontational stance. Her [Ms. Banerjee’s] actions are incomprehensible and unconstitutional. Can anyone imagine that even during the COVID-19 crisis, the Chief Minister has not briefed the Governor and shared no details? The Chief Secretary saw me on April 8 but there has been no effective follow up thereafter. She is the only Chief Minister in the country who has taken an unacceptable stance with the Governor. All I can say is that there is total disregard of Constitutional proscriptions by her. The State is virtually in a vulnerable bind.","Coronavirus | Social distancing has to be 100% during lockdown, says West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar"

Gangakhedkar, however, said these testing kits will be used for surveillance and to monitor whether coronavirus hotspots in the country are increasing or decreasing.,Regarding concern over the efficacy of the rapid antibody testing kits, he said if an antibody test of a person turns out to be positive, one cannot necessarily be sure the person would not get infected ever again. “This means, even if antibody is present, that doesn’t mean it will necessarily be effectively able to fight the virus.”,“Rapid antibody tests are for monitoring surveillance, not for diagnosis. Hence there is no concern with respect to the testing kits being faulty, that concern was with respect to immune response alone,” Dr. Gangakhedkar explained.,Earlier in the day sources confirmed that a large consignment of testing kits for the novel coronavirus pandemic were scheduled to reach India from China on Thursday.,According to available information, 5.5 lakh Rapid Antibody Testing Kits sourced from Guangzhou Wondfo and Zhuhai Livzon and 1 lakh RNA Extraction Kits from MGI Shenzhen were among the consignment.,The consignment is part of the total order of 15 million personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and 1.5 million rapid testing kits that India had ordered from China.,The Hindu,had reported earlier that India had called upon China to fulfil those orders, amid concerns over tightened regulations on exporting such equipment by China after several Western countries complained over quality of exports.,Vikram Misri, India’s ambassador to China said in an online interaction with reporters on Tuesday that deliveries of the medical supplies for India would be stretched until the end of April.

However, the focus is on driving the growth in pulses, coarse cereals and oilseeds.,Due to the travel restrictions imposed by the,COVID-19 pandemic,, the Agriculture Ministry’s annual meeting to review the ongoing rabi or winter season harvest and layout prospects for the coming kharif or summer cropping season is being held via videoconferencing. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar also interacted with State agriculture departments, briefing them on the measures taken to ensure a smooth and safe rabi harvest in the midst of the lockdown.,On Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department issued its first forecast for the monsoon, predicting normal rainfall, with a chance of above normal rain in August and September.,The main kharif season crop is rice, and the Agriculture Ministry is targeting a harvest of 102.6 million tonnes, slightly higher than the last kharif season harvest of 101.95 million tonnes. However, it has lowered its rice production target for the next rabi season to 14.9 million tonnes. This means that the total rice production target for 2020-21 is 117.5 million tonnes, barely higher than the previous year's target of 117.47 million tonnes.,Wheat production is also expected to remain steady, with a 2020-21 target of 106.5 million tonnes, in comparison to the previous year’s estimate of 106.21 million tonnes.,The Agriculture Ministry hopes to ramp up production of coarse cereals this year, but admits that the challenge is how to create demand for nutricereals or millets. It is targeting a harvest of 48.7 million tonnes in comparison to the previous season’s 45.24 million tonnes.,With regard to pulses, the target is 25.3 million tonnes compared to the previous season's estimates of 23 million tonnes, with the entire increase projected to come from the kharif season.,Oilseeds are a major priority, especially due to the disruption in edible oil imports caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The targeted harvest is 36.64 million tonnes, in comparison to the last season's estimates of 34.19 million tonnes. One challenge could be a shortfall in supply of soyabean seeds to the tune of 3.2 lakh quintals, due to unseasonal rains at the time of harvesting the seed crop.,The Ministry has also created an action plan for oil palm plantation, given the disruptions in imports. It hopes to cover 31,500 hectares with about 45 lakh seedlings this year, with the bulk of the plantation in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.",Record foodgrain target of 298.3 million tonnes set

The software used in the online platform is said to be made in China and some calls were being routed through servers in China.,The Cyber Coordination Centre of the MHA issued a set of guidelines for its safe usage by private individuals. It was not for use by government offices and officials, the MHA noted.,The advisory said the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) issued two advisories on February 6 and in March, cautioning on the use of Zoom for office meetings.,,Video meet app Zoom sued by investor over security issues,The March 30 note on the CERT-In website said, “Zoom is a popular videoconferencing platform. Insecure usage of the platform may allow cyber criminals to access sensitive information such as meeting details and conversations.”,Another note posted by the CERT-In on April 2 said that multiple vulnerabilities had been reported in the videoconferencing platform “which could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges or obtain sensitive information.”,The Ministry asked the users to set strong passwords and enable “waiting room” feature so that call managers could have a better control over the participants. It also asked the users to avoid using personal meeting ID to host events and instead use randomly generated meeting IDs for each event and asked to not share links on public platforms.,Several Ministries have been using the platform to convene official meetings. On Thursday, Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju and Tribal Affairs Minister Arjun Munda posted pictures of interaction with sports coaches on Zoom.,,On Thursday, even after the advisory was issued, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) used the platform for a videoconference with around 60 journalists.,An MHA official said that all official video conferences were arranged by National Informatics Centre (NIC) and they were cautious to not use Zoom.,The Union Health Ministry, which is coordinating with the States on COVID-19, has also been using Zoom for videoconferences. A Ministry official said it would discontinue using Zoom.,Ministries of Civil Aviation, Road Transport and Small and Medium Industries also used Zoom since the lockdown began on March 25.,On April 1, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh posted pictures of a virtual meeting with officials where he was seen using Zoom.,BJP chief J.P Nadda has also been conducting meetings through Zoom.,On April 3, Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto, found “significant weakness” in Zoom’s encryption that protects meetings done using the teleconference app. It also identified potential areas of concern in Zoom’s infrastructure, including observing the transmission of meeting encryption keys through China.,The Citizen Lab highlighted that while Zoom was a Silicon Valley-based company, it appeared to own three companies in China through which at least 700 employees were paid to develop Zoom’s software. “This arrangement is ostensibly an effort at labor arbitrage: Zoom can avoid paying US wages while selling to US customers, thus increasing their profit margin. However, this arrangement may make Zoom responsive to pressure from Chinese authorities,” it noted.,According to a blog dated April 1 by Zoom Founder and CEO Eric S Yuan, the usage of Zoom ballooned overnight, including from over 90,000 schools across 20 countries. The maximum number of daily meeting participants of approximately 10 million at the end of December 2019 on Zoom grew to more than 200 million daily meeting participants in March.,“However, we recognize that we have fallen short of the community’s – and our own – privacy and security expectations. For that, I am deeply sorry, and I want to share what we are doing about it,” Mr. Yuan had written.,Mr. Yuan admitted some lapses and committed to addressing two primary topics raised by the Citizen Lab — geo-fencing and meeting encryption.,As per the latest company blog, dated April 15, which follows the second weekly session of a webinar, wherein Mr. Yuan gives updates on Zoom’s ongoing privacy and security efforts, Zoom has added additional features such as placing a new security icon in the meeting controls, changeing Zoom’s default settings and enhancing meeting password complexity, among others.,It has also added that starting April 18, account admins will have the ability to choose whether or not their data is routed through specific data center regions.","‘Zoom’ is not a safe platform, says MHA advisory"

That means you have to move into random testing.”,When asked if he favoured partial lifting of the lockdown, he said, “ It should be a strategic opening. You open particular key areas, use testing to identify and this is where the point of ramping up testing is important. You use testing to identify dynamically which are the hot spots and you clamp down on those hot spots. You create two basic zones in India -a hot spot zone and a non-hot spot zone”.,Besides managing healthcare infrastructure, the economy needed urgent attention as there would be a ‘financial backlash’ because of COVID-19. “You are going to see the first waves of unemployment and then that will start to spiral, you will see massive pressure coming on our financial system.” The government needed to set up structures to manage funding to avoid a financial crisis in a few months, he said.,Mr. Gandhi pointed out that the State governments and district authorities were at the forefront of the battle against the virus and urged the Centre to provide them more funds because “the money given to them right now is nowhere near adequate”.,On migrants getting restive to return to their native place, he said, “There are some people who have suggested moving the migrant people, some people are suggesting don’t move them.

"April 15, 2020 13:48 IST",,"Pandemics,have had great influence in shaping human society and politics throughout history. From the Justinian Plague of sixth century to the,,Spanish flu,of last century, pandemics have triggered the collapse of empires, weakened pre-eminent powers and institutions, created social upheaval and brought down wars. Here’s a look at some of the deadliest pandemics and how they influenced the course of human history.,Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India,One of the,deadliest pandemics,in recorded history broke out in the sixth century in Egypt and spread fast to Constantinople, which was the capital of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. The plague was named after the then Byzantine Emperor Justinian. The outbreak, which spread from Constantinople to both the West and East, had killed up to 25 to 100 million people. The plague hit Constantinople when the Byzantine Empire was at the pinnacle of its power under Justinian’s reign. The Empire had conquered much of the historically Roman Mediterranean coast, including Italy, Rome and North Africa.,Data | United States bears the global brunt of new coronavirus cases,The plague would come back in different waves, finally disappearing in AD 750, after weakening the empire substantially. As the Byzantine Army failed to recruit new soldiers and ensure military supplies to battlegrounds in the wake of the spread of the illness, their provinces came under attack. The plague had also hit Constantinople hard economically, substantially weakening its war machine. By the time plague disappeared, the Empire had lost territories in Europe to the Germanic-speaking Franks and Egypt and Syria to the Arabs.,The Black Death, or pestilence, that hit Europe and Asia in the14th century was the deadliest pandemic recorded in human history. It killed some 75 to 200 million people, according to various estimates. In early 1340s, the plague struck China, India, Syria and Egypt. It arrived in Europe in 1347, where up to 50% of the population died of the disease. The outbreak also had lasting economic and social consequences.,In the words of Stanford historian Walter Scheidel, pandemics are one of the “four horsemen” that have flattened inequality. The other three are wars, revolutions and state failures. In his book,,The Great Leveller,”, Mr. Scheidel writes how the Black Death led to improved wages for serfs and agricultural labourers. “Land became more abundant relative to labour [after the death of millions of working people]. Land rents and interest rates dropped... Landowners stood to lose, and workers could hope to gain,” he writes. In parts of Europe, wages tripled as labour demand rose. And once the economy started improving, the landowning class pressured authorities to check rising labour costs. In England, the Crown passed legislation in this regard the tensions created by which would eventually lead to the Peasant Revolt of 1381. The pandemic also led to largescale Jewish persecution in Europe. Jews, blamed for spreading the illness, were burned alive in many parts of the continent.,Data | The Nizamuddin cluster and the coronavirus spread,The most significant impact of the Black Death was perhaps the weakening of the Catholic Church.

Snowden, a Yale professor and author of,Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present,, observed, the outbreak challenged man’s relationship to God. “How could it be that an event of this kind could occur with a wise, all-knowing and omniscient divinity?” he said in a recent interview. The Church was as helpless as any other institutions as the plague spread like wildfire across the continent, which shook the people’s faith in Church and the clergy. While Church would continue to remain as a powerful institution, it would never regain the power and influence it had enjoyed before the outbreak of the plague. The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century would further weaken the Church.,,,,Also Read,,,,,,Coronavirus | Lifting lockdowns too quickly could spark 'deadly resurgence': WHO,,,,,Coronavirus | Lifting lockdowns too quickly could spark 'deadly resurgence': WHO,Spanish Flu,, which broke out during the last phase of First World War, was the deadliest pandemic of the last century that killed up to 50 million people. The flu was first recorded in Europe and then spread fast to America and Asia. India, one of the worst-hit by the pandemic, lost between 17 and 18 million people, roughly 6% of its population.,One of the major impacts of the outbreak was on the result of the war. Though the flu hit both sides, the Germans and Austrians were affected so badly that the outbreak derailed their offensives. German General Erich Ludendorff in his memoir,,My War Memories, 1914-18,, wrote that the flu was one of the reasons for Germany’s defeat. Germany launched its Spring Offensive on the western front in March 1918. By June and July, the disease had weakened the German units. “Our Army had suffered. Influenza was rampant...It often left a great a greater weakness in its wake than the doctors realised,” he wrote. The Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918 that ended the War. But the flu would continue to ravage parts of the world for many more months.,It’s too early to say how the,COVID-19,outbreak that has already infected about 2 million and killed over 1,26,000 people would change the world. But the outbreak has seen countries, both democratic and dictatorial, imposing drastic restrictions on people’s movements. The western world, the centre of the post-World War order, lies exposed to the attack of the virus. Unemployment rate in the U.S. has shot up to the levels not seen since the end of Second World War. Governments across the world, including the U.S. administration, are beefing up spending to stimulate an economy that shows signs of depression.

However, a pandemic, as we are witnessing today, is a different situation and it may demand a revision of the existing norms in view of the additional allocation of foodgrains at 5 kg a person, as being done under the,Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana,(PMGKAY) for three months (April to June this year in the light of the,coronavirus,(,COVID-19,).

Wheat being once a year crop, it has to be stocked from July for almost a year to meet the year-long demand by the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) till the arrival of the next crop. Similarly, we will have to wait at least for six months to start receiving the inflow of Kharif rice. Given our country’s pattern, we have to procure wheat in about three months for the entire year and rice over six to eight months. So, one should not take a look only at the overall figure, without taking into account the additional allocations due to COVID-19,” Mr. Prasad said.,Asked about the status of the scheme of providing foodgrains to those not covered under the NFSA (such as non-priority household cards), Mr. Prasad said the response had been “good.” So, far, 27,000 tonnes of rice and 18,000 tonnes of wheat had been lifted by the States.,Maharashtra had received 16,326 tonnes of wheat (at a rate of ₹ 21 per kg) and 14,915 tonnes of rice (at ₹ 22 per kg).,Among the southern States which had taken only rice, Kerala had obtained 1,967 tonnes of rice and Karnataka 9,609 tonnes.,To a question whether rice would be given for these cardholders free of cost, as demanded by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K.

Starting from the Horn of Africa, and joined by desert locusts from breeding grounds en route, one locust stream can travel over a land corridor passing over Yemen, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and India, impacting farmlands in Punjab, Haryana and the Indo-Gangetic plain. But another stream passing over the Indian Ocean can directly attack farms in peninsular India, and then head towards Bangladesh. Together, this can cause a serious food security issue,” the source said.,The destructive power of a typical locust swarm, which can vary from less than one square kilometre to several hundred square kilometres, is enormous, says the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on its website. A one square kilometre swarm, containing about 40 million locusts, can in a day eat as much food as 35,000 people, assuming that each individual consumes 2.3 kg of food per day.,An FAO situation update of April 21 paints a grim picture. It spotlights that desert locusts, which are breeding this spring in East Africa, Yemen and southern Iran, will gravely heighten the threat to food security in the Afro-Asian region.,Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India,In Iran, locust swarms could be forming near Jask — a port city on the Gulf of Oman, as well the Sistan-Baluchistan province, bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, opening two trajectories of movement. In Pakistan, breeding grounds have been detected in Balochistan, the Indus Valley as well as Punjab. Besides, limited breeding has also been spotted near the Indian border. “We are hoping that the Pakistani side will take active measures to contain the crisis in their country, which can minimise the impact on India and beyond,” the source said.,Most countries combating locust swarms are mainly relying on organophosphate chemicals, which are applied in small concentrated doses by vehicle-mounted and aerial sprayers.,The looming locust attack, which could undermine food security in the Afro-Asian region, follows the economic devastation, and the savaging of incomes, by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a briefing to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, David Beasley, Executive Director of the UN World Food Programme, warned that the pandemic could now be fusing into a “hunger pandemic”.,“,Lockdowns,and economic recession are expected to lead to a major loss of income among the working poor... The loss of tourism receipts will damage countries such as Ethiopia, where it accounts for 47% of total exports. The collapsing oil prices in lower-income countries like South Sudan will have an impact significantly, where oil accounts for 98.8% of total exports. And, of course, when donor countries’ revenues are down, how much impact will this have on life saving foreign aid?” he observed.,Mr. Beasley estimated that COVID-19 would push an additional 130 million people to the brink of starvation, bringing the global total of those facing extreme hunger to 265 million.","After COVID-19, India’s next challenge could be mega-sized locust attack this summer"

Edited excerpts:,By and large, the consensus was the Ebola response was largely successful. There were deaths but illness was contained to the region where it originated. Here you have an unprecedented challenge. The WHO was established in 1948 and there hasn’t been a worldwide pandemic with this kind of devastation that has come across its path. Something like this is calamitously challenging for the WHO. And then you have the decision of the United States [on April 15] to withhold funding at this peak time. The U.S. contributes something like 15 per cent of the WHO budget. That is a pretty substantial sum of money that is going to disappear from the WHO’s kitty. All of that I think adds to the challenges it is facing.,Also read: Editorial |,Disastrous decision: On Trump halting funds to WHO,I really think Mr. Trump is honestly trying to find a scapegoat for his own administration  failing in preparing the U.S. sooner for what has turned out to be the biggest public health emergency they have ever had. The fact is, if you look at what the WHO did or didn’t do, one can certainly accept the charge that they were to willing to give China a free pass at the beginning of the crisis. They made some wrong calls on the coronavirus, for example the statement on January 14 doubting human-to-human transmission which was at least three weeks out of date. And the Americans, of course, are quite bugged they continue blocking participation by Taiwan.,,Coronavirus | Shashi Tharoor on how the WHO has handled the COVID-19 pandemic | The Hindu In Focus Podcast,Honestly, I don’t think it’s easy to blame the WHO for it. One of the institutional challenges for any UN body is that it tends to be beholden to its most powerful member states. The UN itself in many ways reflects the dominance of certain countries, particularly of the Security Council. That is simply the way in which an organisation of member states is structured. We are mirror of the world. We reflect the inequalities and power structure in the globe itself. So for any institution to just openly start doubting or questioning assurances given by a powerful member state would be a challenge at the best of times.,I am not saying the WHO covered itself in glory in two issues particularly, its early comfort levels with Chinese actions and some of their statements before they finally on March 11 declared a pandemic. Their statements in January were perhaps a little weak. By the end of January, they began to get a little more urgent in warnings, and all they said in February was pretty reasonable. They were obviously deferential to a powerful member state. I am afraid the problem is if this was something that started in the U.S., they would have probably been deferential to the U.S. also. The difference is the U.S. being a democracy with a free press, they would have not found it easy to suppress the kind of details that are only now emerging from China.  It is shocking that [on April 17] China increased the death toll in Wuhan by 50 per cent because it was getting impossible to conceal the fact that their numbers were lies. Now the truth is if you have to blame somebody, you have to blame Beijing for having done the wrong thing, tried to supress the news, tried to conceal information, and taken no effective steps in the beginning to prevent the virus from spreading, and then misled the WHO, rather than blame the WHO principally for merely mirroring what the Chinese were saying.,There were two things. First, the WHO didn’t send experts to Wuhan at the very beginning. As soon as the first news was announced by China on December 31, there should have been a WHO delegation of experts on the plane to get an independent view. That wasn’t there so they were only relying on the Chinese view. That is something you can blame the WHO for. The second thing is for a few weeks they continued to take a very relaxed line, relaying the Chinese assurances, frankly as if they didn’t need to be questioned independently.,We have a constitutional problem with all UN agencies that the head of the agency who is elected after all with support of powerful member states, does not enjoy the independence and autonomy that should come with a position of that stature. If we were, for example, to adopt a policy of a single non-renewable term for maybe six or seven years,  rather than two terms of five which is normal practice, then you might actually give a leader authority to take certain independent actions.,Nonetheless, don’t forget the UN is not larger or more powerful than its member states. Had the WHO wanted to send a team and for whatever reason China refused to give a visa, then they couldn’t have gone. The UN system is not a supra-national body. It is an international body and it concerns nation states who are sovereign. Just as Israel denied a UN team access to occupied territories, India has refused permission to some UN observers to go to Kashmir and so on, countries have the right to do that. We can say the WHO should have at least proposed it, and the world would have drawn conclusions if China rejected a visa. But the WHO was not taking enough initiative initially. I would still say the principal fault is with Beijing and not the WHO, which is still a body that is dependent on member states.,Also read:,Coronavirus | Will the U.S. freeze on funding affect WHO’s functioning?,It is fair to say that Dr Brundtland, who was not elected with Chinese support, had a different attitude to this than Dr Tedros, who was very much a candidate backed not just by China, but by India too and many other developing countries.  Dr Brundtland, having been a former prime minister and a world leader with some heft, had a certain stature which gave her independence. And in any case, she wasn’t interested in seeking re-election after SARS. So it is a difficult comparison to make with a first-term Director General who is from the developing world. You can say Dr Tedros was unduly deferential to one of his most powerful member states. Arguably in any list of the top two or three most powerful, influential states in the WHO, China would figure.,India is a member of every UN body and every country knows how these bodies work. The governments of the world actually want UN agencies to be beholden to governments, for the most part. When they fail to assert enough independence and autonomy, the same governments start making these agencies a scapegoat. When I was at the UN, my then boss [Secretary General] Kofi Annan would often jokingly say about the initials SG by which we used to call him, ‘I know what that stands for – scapegoat!’. And that was really what often happened.,In my book ‘The New World Disorder’ that I co-authored with Samir Saran, we argued that international institutions are indeed waning in legitimacy because they suffer from politicisation, manipulation, lack of independent leadership, lack of representation and purpose. I am sorry to say seeing this happening, and also seeing another trend we highlighted, the resurgence of nationalisms sweeping the world, has been pretty dismaying.,Had global governance been working as effectively as it should have, the world would have identified the coronavirus as soon as it emerged, the WHO would have sounded a global alarm early about its dangers, and the world would have collectively identified and publicised the best practices that should  have been adopted by all countries to prevent and limit the spread. That this did not happen is a damning indictment not so much of the WHO alone, but of all our sovereign states and of the state of our new world disorder. I certainly hope that one of the lessons we learn from this setback is when the pandemic is over, we have to sit down and say, how can we strengthen international systems and institutions, and reform them as radically as necessary, in order to forestall another global tragedy of this magnitude.,The signs are indeed for a resurgence of national sovereignty. We are seeing more and more ethno-nationalism, populism, and a wave of nationalism that many countries are riding, certainly including Xi Jinping’s China, Putin’s Russia, Trump’s America, Modi’s India, and Brexit Britain, in addition to many European countries facing the same thing. This suggests we will actually go in the wrong direction and likely throw up more barriers and create more  nationalist, defiant sovereignties. I believe that is the wrong way to go. I genuinely believe globalisation cannot be completely unrolled and that India must play a role in defying this impulse of closing countries off to the international community. We need to create a new ethic and resolve for global governance.,We have to recognize if the WHO had limitations, these are limitations that governments have imposed upon it. If the world has to draw from this a conclusion that we actually need institutions of greater independence in all our collective interest then maybe we can reform these institutions, to give them that independence. In particular, if we elect WHO heads who are allowed to challenge countries, for example as a matter of authority they can go and see for themselves independently if the assurances they are getting from governments are valid or not. All of these things require a certain dilution of a national government’s prerogative and that’s something governments have proven reluctant to do. I hope a country like India will be a sane voice for this. Even Brexit Britain has announced it will give an additional 65 million Pounds to the WHO because of the U.S. pulling out, which I thought was a fine gesture. We are seeing some countries are rallying around. The Chinese, inevitably, had hinted they too will increase funding partly to compensate for America, but the Chinese unfortunately seem to demand others pay a price for this generosity with silence for Chinese misdemeanours. So Pakistan remains quiet on the Uighur Muslims being mistreated because of $65 billion that China is pouring into Pakistan under the Belt and Road Initiative. I am sure you will not find Italy and Spain saying anything nasty about China with all the medical support, PPE equipment they are receiving. These are realities of geopolitics we simply cannot overlook.,I think strengthening the autonomy of these institutions is important and that’s how independence of heads of institutions, and by extension of the institution itself, becomes a key factor. The second is certainly preparation to cede a certain authority, that yes a government may provide its own views to the WHO, but if the WHO independently decides it wants to verify things for itself, governments as a price of being a member of the WHO should not have the authority to deny a visa or travel permission. I have heard the story you mentioned that China did block a WHO delegation from visiting Wuhan in the first weeks, and Dr Tedros had to fly to Beijing to negotiate access. At the same time, it is also true the WHO took the Chinese position that travel restrictions are ineffective and need not be imposed at a time when the only restrictions would have been against China, which would have been the victim of such a restriction. Governments have to show a greater degree of statesmanship if we are going to get these organisations to be effective in a way that no organisation that depends on member states can be expected to be, beyond a point.","Coronavirus | If WHO has limitations, these have been imposed on it by nations, says Shashi Tharoor"

This impacted the cost of air tickets as the flights flew empty one way.,“The first airline we spoke to was unable to provide a quote [for cost of ticket] as ferrying people only one way was not economic for a long haul direct flight to Australia,” said Mr. O’Farrell, who said that Australian Consular teams had been trying to assist all their nationals stranded in India despite several movement-related restrictions.,The Indian government, said Mr. O'Farrell, had also expedited the process of refunding of tickets of Australian nationals booked between March 25 and April 14.,The government in Canberra has set up a quarantine facility where passengers will have to spend a fortnight upon their return.

"April 25, 2020 20:19 IST","NEW DELHI ,","Only 15% of poor households have received the one kg of pulses promised for April under the Centre’s COVID-19 welfare package, according to an analysis of the government agency data. Of the 1.96 lakh tonnes of pulses that should have been given to more than 19 crore households this month, only 30,000 tonnes have been distributed so far, according to the Consumer Affairs Department.,Distribution is likely to speed up by the first week of May, with delays caused by the fact that the government only stores unmilled pulses in its godowns, and has had to start a massive milling operation before delivering them to ration shops.,Last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced extra ration allocations from April to June as part of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, said to be worth ₹1.7 lakh crore. All 80 crore National Food Security Act beneficiaries were to get an extra 5 kg of rice or wheat each month, while each household was to get one kg of pulses to meet protein needs.,Given that all States already distribute rice and wheat through a well-established Public Distribution System, with grain provided from a network of the FCI warehouses, distribution of the promised extra grain began early in April. However, the distribution to more than 19 crore families was stalled by several hurdles.,The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation is the nodal agency which procures and stores a buffer stock of pulses. To provide the necessary 5.88 lakh tonnes of cleaned and milled pulses promised under the scheme, NAFED has pressed over 100 dall mills into service to process about 8.5 lakh tonnes of unmilled pulses lying in about 165 godowns across the country.,“The scale of this operation is massive and far more complex than foodgrain movement,” according to a Consumer Affairs statement. “Each kg of pulse goes through at least three [in many cases four] trips by truck and as many cycles of loading and unloading. While for long distances, transport is being done through goods train, in most cases transportation is by road through trucks.”,Over four weeks, the operation involves about two lakh truck trips, a challenging target during the lockdown as many godowns and mills lie in hotspot areas. Availability of trucks and labour for loading and unloading has been a major problem in these areas, said the department.,Of the 1.96 lakh tonnes needed for April, about 1.45 lakh tonnes have been offered to States already. Only a few States have dal mills within their own jurisdiction and they have been asked to lift the milled pulses themselves to speed up the process.,So far, States have picked up only a third of the month’s requirement, with 17 States and Union Territories having begun distribution. Others intend to distribute the first instalment in the first week of May, along with that month’s foodgrain ration. In a number of States, efforts are being made to distribute the pulse ration for all three months in May itself.",Only 15% of poor households have received 1 kg of pulses promised for April

After the COVID-19 outbreak and the role of governments being assessed so closely, this trend will completely overshadow identity politics,” he said.,The next big election in India is the Assembly election in Bihar due in October-November.

We are now dipping very deep into our reserves and will find it very tough to carry on operations if we urgently don’t receive adequate blood supply. Now the crisis is such that we are calling listed donors and those with rare blood groups to come in and donate. Also, there is a shortage of the most commonly seen B-positive blood group,” said Himanshu Lamba, Consultant, Department of Lab Transfusion Medicine, Manipal Hospital in Dwarka.,He added that hospitals are either calling donors personally or contacting them through SMS and even offering to arrange transport for them if they were finding it tough to come to the medical centres.,Thalassemics India, an NGO working for patients, has now requested the Health Ministry to help tide over the shortage. “Thalassemia patients need repeated blood transfusions to survive.

What is the government planning to do now?” asked a worried Shobha Tuli of Thalassemics India.,She explained that donors were hesitant to travel to hospitals now to donate blood, and medical supplies were not delivered countrywide by her organisation due to the lockdown, which meant that patients with low immunity could be at risk. Also, donor passes had not been made by some hospitals, which was adding to the problem.,The organisation has suggested that the States should also try and arrange transportation to donors, and even patients, if possible, to come to medical centres. The group has noted that the worst hit are patients from small cities and villages.,R. K. Jain, Secretary General, Indian Red Cross Society Blood Bank, speaking to,The Hindu,noted, “As of now, the situation is under control though there have been sporadic spikes in demand. Regular surgeries are not taking place, which has reduced the demand [for blood] drastically, but we are operating a 24X7 control room for donors and those needing blood to ensure that there is no shortage. We have also introduced pick-drop facilities and have allowed patients, especially those with blood disorders, to bring in friends and relatives who can replenish the blood taken from us. Though Red Zones in Delhi are growing and access to the set of donors here is now getting cut-off, we have 38,000 registered donors in Delhi itself and we feel that this should see us through for the time being. We may look at other options later on.”,To ensure that the blood taken is virus-free, Dr. Vanshree Singh, Director, Indian Red Cross Society Blood Bank, said a detailed history is taken of the donor and those with any flu-like symptoms are not allowed to donate. “We also look at the contact history and which zone they come from to eliminate any contamination,” she said.,The Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan, speaking about the shortage of blood, said that hospitals should now start working on ensuring sufficient stock of blood for transfusion by promoting voluntary blood donors and utilising various services like mobile blood collection vans with the help of the Indian Red Cross Society.,The Health Ministry has asked the Indian Red Cross Society to send mobile blood collection vans to the premises of regular blood donors to facilitate them to come forward for blood donation.,According to the National Blood Transfusion Council, there are 2,023 blood banks in India, which receive 78% of their blood supply from voluntary donors. The Indian Red Cross Society has noted that though there is drop in blood collection, efforts are underway to rectify the situation.,The World Health Organization recommends that the blood requirement of 1% of a country’s population be used as a ballpark estimate of its blood needs. By this measure, India was short of 1.9 million units of blood as per data presented to the Lok Sabha in 2018.,But the problem is not restricted to the supply of blood alone, with the Union Health Ministry having to intervene and ask hospitals to not turn away patients suffering from respiratory or heart diseases, those who require blood transfusions, and pregnant mothers, who have reportedly been facing harassment.,While hospitals are citing the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases as the reason they are advising other patients to stay away from hospitals, the Health Minister noted that the denial of treatment to patients who have been visiting hospitals in case of emergencies, and are being forced to visit a number of hospitals one after another, resulting in the denial of immediate medical attention, which may result in the loss of lives, is being taken up very seriously.,“Hospitals have to remember that patients who are really ill and require urgent medical attention are venturing out with great difficulty to reach the hospital for treatment in this situation.

INDSCI-SIM accomplishes that,” said Gautam Menon of The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, and Asoka University, Delhi, who is one of the people who developed the model.,In the model, each State or City is represented by a population, every one of which is described by nine compartments representing various stages of the COVID-19 disease progression. This extends the four-compartment SEIR model that is usually used (SEIR stands for Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered).,As an illustrative example, the scientists have used the data for the population from the 2011 census. They showed that when there were fewer infected people, one can have a good control over the number of hospitalised people at any time by ramping up quarantine-testing measures in a calculated way. This should include the asymptomatic people being tested too. For example, given that the supply of ventilators is limited, if Tamil Nadu has about 3,600 ventilators available, if 60% of the population could be tested over a period of 240 days (and quarantined), they show that the curve is flattened significantly so as to match the availability of ventilators.,Also read:,,Coronavirus | Rate at which COVID-19 cases doubling in India improves to 7.5 days, says Health Ministry,“Our results underline the need for more broad-based testing as the only long-term solution to stopping the disease in its tracks.

"April 21, 2020 18:16 IST",,"Over 600 scientists endorsed a letter to the Prime Minister, urging him to take certain measures to fight out the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.,The letter is below:,To,The Prime Minister, Government of India,Sir,,We welcome the measures the government has taken to ensure physical distancing to arrest the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the experiences of Singapore, South Korea, and Japan have shown that social distancing by itself does not suffice; it is necessary to embark on testing on a very large scale to identify and isolate not only the symptomatic patients but also the infected asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, the country also has to prepare the health-care system to be able to treat millions of patients, if the situation arises. In this context we would like to put forth a few concrete proposals to deal with the crisis.,1. Whenever anybody tests positive, extensive testing has to be done covering the whole neighbourhood, the nearby market area, and the places that the individual visited over the past few days, at least by random sampling. That will require increasing the rate of testing to a substantially higher level compared to what is being done presently. This will require not only a larger number of test-kits, but also a large number of trained personnel. We propose that unemployed science graduates be specially recruited for this purpose and should be trained on a war footing.,2. Most biology departments in research institutions and universities have RT-PCR machines in BSL2 facilities which can be used for COVID-19 detection. Faculty and students of many of these institutions are prepared to offer their services in this crisis period. Effective steps should be taken to utilize these facilities to enhance the testing capability of the nation.,3. India is lagging way behind in genetic sequencing of the novel coronavirus. We do not have sufficient data on which mutated variants of the virus are there in India, neither do we know anything about the rate at which it is mutating—all of which are crucial for effective management of the pandemic. Therefore, we request you to increase the number of genomic sequencing of the coronavirus isolated from Indian patients, and to make the results publicly available.,4. Isolation wards should be created in district and subdivision-level hospitals, and even in the primary health centres, equipping them with the necessary infrastructure to treat COVID-19 patients. The government should use the facilities in private hospitals to create special wards to provide free treatment to COVID-19 patients. All indoor stadiums and similar indoor spaces should be turned into COVID field hospitals. Private doctors, nurses, and semi-skilled helpers should be recruited to serve these makeshift hospitals. Complete safety should be ensured for the people serving in these hospitals.,5. The emerging situation will require large-scale production of PPE gear for health-care personnel, and masks and sanitizers for common people. The government should initiate planned production of these essential items by requisitioning closed factory spaces and by engaging workers rendered jobless by the lock-down.,6. The nation needs to produce a large number of ventilators in a short time. Many relatively inexpensive designs of ventilators (including mechanized Ambu bags) have been proposed by Indian investigators. Some international companies have also made their ventilator designs public. Indian pharmaceutical companies and other manufacturers should be requisitioned to mass produce such ventilators to meet the nation's requirement. Building an Indian innovation-development-production infrastructure is the need of the hour.,7. Migrant labourers are stuck in different states due to sudden announcement of the lock- down. Most of them are living in crowded places and it will not be possible for them to maintain physical distancing—a practice necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Central Government should initiate a dialogue with the states to provide transit of these helpless people to their home states by means of special trains. Once they reach their respective subdivisions, they should be quarantined in primary health centres or school buildings for 14 days before allowing them to go home. Adequate financial and material support should be provided to daily wage labourers and poor people who have lost their livelihood due to the lock-down.,8. The expenses of the above programmes should be raised by levying taxes on the super-rich, and by using Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds of all national and multinational companies—not by taxing the common people. Since health is a state subject, the Union Government should allocate adequate funds to the states for combating this critical situation. Since research scholars are losing valuable research time due to the lock-down, their tenure of fellowship should be extended by at least 6 months.,We hope that the government will give due consideration to the above proposals.,Signed --,Soumitro Banerjee, IISER Kolkata,Alladi Sitaram, Indian Statistical Institute(Retd.),Jayant Murthy Indian Institute of Astrophysics,Debashis Mukherjee, S N Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences,Debabrata Ghosh, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi,D S Ray, IACS,Naba K Mondal, INSA Senior Scientist, SINP, Kolkata,Partha Majumder, National Inst. of Biomedical Genomics and ISI,Dipankar Chatterji, Indian Institute of Science,Ayan Banerjee, IISER Kolkata,Dhrubajyoti Mukhopadhyay, Raman Centre for Applied and Interdisciplinary Sciences,Pradipta Bandyopadhyay, Jawaharlal Nehru University,Parongama Sen, University of Calcutta,Damodar Maity, IIT Kharagpur,Sarbari Bhattacharya, Bangalore University,Nilesh Maiti, Shishuram Das College, Calcutta University,Srikanth Sastry, JNCASR, Bengaluru,Partho Sarothi Ray, IISER Kolkata,Anupam Basu, IIT Kharagpur,Amitabha Basu, Retired Scientist, CSIR-NPL, New Delhi,Ajit Srivastava, Institute of Physics Bhubaneswar,Prof. Rajan Gurukkal, State Higher Education Council, Kerala,R Ramanujam, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai,Indrani Bose, Retired scientist, Bose Institute, Kolkata,Anindita Bhadra, IISER Kolkata,Aniket Sule, HBCSE-TIFR, Mumbai,Raju Mukherjee, IISER Tirupati,Enakshi Bhattacharya, IIT Madras,Pradipta Bandyopadhyay, Indian Statistical Institute,Nagarjuna, (GN) TIFR,Abhijit Majumder, IIT Bombay,Chandan Dasgupta, Indian Institute of Science,Prof Pranab Roy, Institute of Child Health.,Siddhartha Sen, IIT Kharagpur,Pabitra Banik, Indian Statistical Institute,Debabrata Bera, Jadavpur University,Sharath Ananthamurthy, University of Hyderabad,Arunan.M.C., Kishore Bharati,Indrani Bose Retired scientist, Bose Institute, Kolkata,Asoke P Chattopadhyay University of Kalyani,And 600 others,",Letter from India March for Science to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi

Some states are strict and some have resumed work. India has to consider how the economy functions and how the epidemic can be controlled, so it does not pay a high price for epidemic prevention.”,He said in this view, India’s approach to adopt a long-term strategy made sense, including its approach to testing. While India’s approach in tackling COVID-19 has been different from China’s sweeping lockdowns and mass quarantines, India’s strategy was understandable for its national conditions. “Every country should find a way that suits them according to their situation,” he said.,Also read:,Coronavirus | India’s COVID-19 recovery rate improves to nearly 20%,He suggested China’s “100%” lockdown, or Australia’s approach of locking down until very low numbers of new cases were reached, was unlikely to be replicated in other countries, and added that he did not necessarily advocate a one-size-fits-all approach.,“I personally feel that India does not need to adopt such a strategy,” he said. “I think their government would probably follow the U.S. strategy”.,Also read:,Coronavirus: Phase-1 human trial of Oxford University vaccine to begin today,India may not be able to keep cases to as low a level as did many places in China — which managed to limit the spread outside of the Hubei province epicentre with mass lockdowns, quarantines and testing — but at the same time, the rise in cases did not mean the spread was uncontrollable.,“Do not look only at the number of cases,” he said. “There have been hundreds of thousands of cases in the U.S. and Europe, more than in India. The lives of Europeans still has not stopped, and they are preparing to resume work, school and business.”,Dr. Zhang made the comments on Wednesday while interacting with Chinese nationals in India in an online exchange arranged by the Chinese Embassy, and fielding questions on India’s strategy, testing and the future trajectory of cases.,He believed the global pandemic was broadly under control, and as the number of diagnosed cases increased, the mortality rate would further reduce. This outbreak, he said, was very different from SARS in 2003, which had a far higher mortality among both young and old. This also explained why some countries were choosing to reopen their economies and schools.,On the question of whether Indians had a higher immunity than the rest of the world — a matter that has been widely debated in China — Dr. Zhang said the incidence rate in India suggested this was not the case.

The CJI clarified that,hearing of cases through videoconferencing,are not in-camera hearings and virtual courts are not closed courts.,Imagine if this was an earthquake or floods or whatever... This is really a situation when the Executive gets into action. The usual three ‘Ms’ are ‘men, material and money’. It is very difficult for the court to assume charge and say ‘this is what the priority should be’ and ‘this is what it should be like’.

"April 26, 2020 20:10 IST",,"China’s response to,COVID-19,has shown both the weaknesses and strengths of its system, says Richard McGregor, Senior Fellow at the Lowy Institute and author of,The Party: The Secret World of China’s Communist Rulers,. The Party is fighting battles on many fronts, facing political and economic challenges at home as well as an unfavourable geopolitical environment, he said.,Every challenge looks like the biggest crisis, but I would say the answer to that is yes. Certainly the global financial crisis in 2008-2009 was a big challenge for China. They got through that through a massive stimulus programme. I think this time is a little bit different.  We've not only got what is going to be an extended economic downturn – this can't be turned around by a sort of wave of  infrastructure spending, so we've got probably the longest downturn post-Tiananmen or maybe since the late seventies – plus we have also got a sort of global political crisis or global political fight over the origins of the virus, and responsibility and accountability for it. Now China is a much bigger economy, and a much more powerful country. That doesn't mean that it can sail through something like this, and they are fighting on a number of fronts.,Also read:,Coronavirus | India following U.S. trajectory in COVID-19 cases, says Chinese expert,It’s just absolutely amazing, can you imagine six weeks ago, even a month ago, that China would be heralding its handling of this crisis as a vindication for their system? But that's where we are these days. You know, we should say, of course, that in some respects, that sort of propaganda is as much directed internally as it is externally. We shouldn't forget that. But I think China's handling of this crisis really shows the deep weaknesses and also some of the strengths of their system. So let me explain that.,First of all, there's absolutely no doubt that China mishandled the early stages of this crisis. Now, we don't quite know exactly what happened. There was certainly a cover up at some levels. There was a bureaucratic mess, fighting between the localities and the centre. There were all sorts of things happening and that, I think, was a show of China's weaknesses. In other words, a lack of openness, lack of transparency, endemic bureaucratic problems, and a fear of offending and reporting to the centre.,Now once China started to take it seriously – and we should emphasize we're kind of in early days still – we did see a quite remarkable demonstration of the power of the Party-State. When you think what they managed to do, in a short period of time – no discussion like we have in messy democracies – they locked down in residences up to a 700 million people, they mobilised the army, they mobilised the paramilitary, they commandeered businesses to make for the state personal protective equipment, they shut factories, they shut businesses. So we did see a real display of what the state in China can do. And on its own terms, it was effective. You know, I don't believe every Chinese figure to the tee, but there's no doubt that we've got rapidly declining infections in China and large parts of the country relatively speaking getting back to normal. So we saw the good side and the bad side of the Chinese system.,Also read:,China approves third COVID-19 vaccine for clinical trials,The narrative of Xi in charge of this crisis has got some holes in it, maybe deliberately. Certainly in the rewriting that's going on now on the successes of this, that they are all down to Xi, and to his focus on the strong central power of the Party. But if you go back a little bit, the fact that he in theory ordered that this be handled on January 7 only came out much, much later. And that would be a strange thing to take credit for because we had no reporting of cases from early January to January 16. Clearly the issue was not being handled then. I think that sort of came out in almost a moment of panic in China to show that Xi had been on top of this from the start. Certainly once he did focus on it on January 20, when he was basically behind the Wuhan lockdown, the system was mobilised. That's true.,But at the same time, it might be good internal propaganda if China is successful and they can portray China as successful compared to other countries. They've got enough control of the media to do that. But externally, I don't see many too many countries taking Xi as a kind of great leader and a magician for the role he played here because clearly the system didn't work at the start. There's one other point. One reason --  and there is speculation about this in China -- that the centre didn't focus on this until January 20 was in the three days beforehand Xi was on a state visit to Myanmar. And people around him might have thought they couldn't upset that with talk about the problems of a new coronavirus. So in some respects the system didn't jump into action until Xi was back from overseas. And that might mean that there's another two or three important day lost in fighting the virus.,Also read:,Coronavirus | China reports rise in cases, most from abroad,I think it certainly does reflect the broader sentiment among some of the Chinese elite, which is very critical of Xi. We've known that for some time. It's not surprising given what a tough, remorseless leader that Xi has been both in terms of the anti corruption campaign and crushing any opposition generally.,Mr. Ren is an interesting character. I've met him and interviewed him many years ago. He's always been outspoken. He was, of course, most outspoken many years ago on issues of real estate. He was a fierce opponent of the government investing in public housing, rather saying that such issues of property should be left to the private sector. And he's generally been in favour of more untrammelled markets in China, which, of course, is another reason why he wouldn't like Xi who's lent towards the state side.,Having said that, it's interesting. Ren certainly got into trouble, but he doesn't seem to have gotten to as much trouble as you might have thought. I think he was suspended from the Communist Party just for a year. He wasn't expelled altogether. He might be in some form of home detention now. But it was really telling. It was a brave essay. It was eloquent. I think it reflected many of the concerns of a lot of people in China, the technocrats and the like, what they dislike about Xi. Of course, the Party has put a lid on it without sort of ejecting him from public life for ever and a day.,,That is an odd case. As you say, the investigations by the Communist Party's anti-corruption watchdog often do take a long time. They often sort of proceed from previous investigations. In other words when other people have been investigated, they are interrogated. And they usually give up people they've worked with or they're expected to confess, not just only on themselves, but on others as well. We don't quite know whether this was at the end of a lengthy period of investigation, or whether it happened suddenly. Certainly before people are detained, they often drift out of the centre of public life for a few months beforehand before things catch up with them. But in this case, as you say, Mr. Sun had been actively involved in Wuhan and then suddenly he was disappeared. So this is a another case of where the lack of transparency in China leaves us scratching our head.,,,It’s really hard to say. In many Western countries, China is going to be in a worse off position. The US-China relationship continues to break down at a rapid pace. China's relations with a lot of European countries, France, Germany, Britain, has been strained by this. Partly because of the issue we discussed earlier, the lack of transparency and partly because of a distaste at what many people see as China's efforts to exploit the turnaround in their country and gain sort of a propaganda or PR win from it.,It's too early to tell. I think one of the big issues is yes, the China's economy is starting to steady but it's by no means in recovery mode. And we've got to see how much they can come back.  There's a lot of problems hidden under the surface in China and once growth slows dramatically, they will come to the surface. The authorities have got lots of firepower, but nonetheless they just can't click their fingers like they did in 2008 to get out of this. It's also going to depend on what happens in the US with Trump in the US election, and whether the US economy and the US political system can right itself. That's another unknown.,It's also going to depend on countries surrounding China immediately, like Japan, South Korea, and of course, India. But without some sort of open accounting of what happened in Wuhan, which China is resisting, it's hard to see how they come out of this with their reputation enhanced. They might be just as powerful, but it's going to be an even more abrasive power than it is at the moment.,I'm not so sure. Political decoupling might be, economic decoupling or trade decoupling is another matter because the two countries and global systems generally are so enmeshed, it's very difficult to unwind them. You're certainly going to see it happen in some areas in the manufacture of drugs, antibiotics, India has an interest in that. You're going to see some of it in terms of manufacturing personal protective equipment, medical supplies, but that's really not a big deal at the end of the day. But do you see the sort of globalization unwinding as some people assert will happen? I think it's too early to call that yet.,There's going to be a lot of countries hedging their bets with China. But China's logistical strengths, its industrial clusters, its ports, its railways, in other words, the ability to trade and do business are immensely powerful. You can't simply replicate that in other countries. Businesses at the end of the day, particularly coming out of the trough following this crisis, governments aren't going to be able to subsidize too many businesses for too long. So I'm a bit cautious to overstate that at the moment.,I think it's more long-lasting actually. A week or so before India did that, Australia did something similar but without mentioning China by name. Australia said that any foreign investment proposals – usually there's a threshold at which the government doesn't look at them -- but they basically said anything has to be looked at. And that was basically aimed at China as well, even if they didn't say so. There's little doubt that the climate for China investing in the US is not going to get better soon. Europe in recent years has gradually been trying to put up more regulatory barriers to particular purchases of Chinese tech equipment. The UK is a similar case, right now.,We are going to see ongoing Chinese investment in countries in Africa, perhaps in resources. Perhaps in Brazil, Argentina, and the like, which aren’t so sensitive about it. But generally the boom in outward Chinese FDI, which we saw in 2016-16, I think that's over for the moment. There's going to be many, many more barriers. It might not matter as much to China as a few years ago because China itself is advanced far along up the industrial chain. But yes, I think this is now permanent feature of the landscape.,","Coronavirus | The COVID-19 pandemic is China’s biggest crisis since Tiananmen, says Richard McGregor"

I see even faster shifts in the Indo-Pacific power balance, with an associated sharpening of strategic competition. And an even more factious multilateral system,” he stated.,On enhancing bilateral cooperation, he said there were many ways the two could reinforce each other’s efforts and one of the ways was “we can make defence facilities available to each other to expand our militaries’ respective operational reach.” This was already an evolving area with a logistics support agreement in the final stages of being concluded.,The High Commissioner designate also referred to the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean Region which is emerging as a regional hub for monitoring maritime movements and cooperation. “We’re glad to be contributing a Liaison Officer to it in due course,” he stated.,He also noted the increasingly common platforms operated by the two militaries acquired from the U.S., the P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, C-17 and C-130 transport aircraft, and India’s soon-to-be-acquired MH-60 Romeo multi-role helicopters.","Australia pitches for trilateral cooperation with India, Indonesia"

"April 26, 2020 20:38 IST",,"Zarina, as she was known, made an indelible mark in the international art world as one of South Asia’s leading artists. Widely recognised in her lifetime, she will be remembered as a fiercely independent woman artist who achieved artistic recognition on her own terms, through powerful yet restrained works that drew on her linguistic and cultural heritage and experiences of estrangement, dislocation and loss.,Zarina was raised within the cultural and intellectual milieu of the Aligarh Muslim Uuniversity, a world that informed her aesthetic sensibility, encompassing her father’s history books and the strong feminine bonds of the,zenana.,She took up printmaking while married to an officer in the Indian Foreign Service, first woodblock carving in Bangkok, then learning experimental ink and intaglio techniques at the Atelier 17, the cosmopolitan Paris studio run by Bill Hayter (the subject of a focused exhibition in 2016 at the Metropolitan Museum,,Workshop and Legacy: Stanley William Hayter, Krishna Reddy, Zarina Hashmi,). Zarina is best known for her series of etchings and woodblock prints that express the estrangement of migration, geographical dislocation and exile, captured in works such as,Travels with Rani,2008, a dotted diagram of all the towns and train stations she and her family had passed through, forming a mind map of an undivided subcontinent.,She experimented with papermaking techniques, testing the limits of the medium with expert craftsmen in India, moulding and piercing paper into sculptural and architectural forms that resembled packed earth, terracotta and stone (,I Whispered to the Earth,1979,,Wall II,1979,,Fence,1980,,Pool I,,1980, Tate Collection). The opportunity to leave Delhi for the United States in the 1970s brought personal and artistic freedom, but also many years of quiet struggle.,After itinerance for many years between training in Japan, teaching in California and New York, her family in Aligarh, Delhi and Karachi, and an artistic circle in New York, she was able to base herself in her studio in Manhattan while continuing to exhibit regularly in India. With strong opinions and immense self-discipline, Zarina resisted being pigeon-holed into the prevalent art world orthodoxies.,Her peers included Judy and Krishna Reddy, Ram Rahman, Mehli Gobhai and Meena Alexander among others, and she joined postcolonial feminist networks, co-curating an exhibition with the Cuban artist Ana Mendieta at the A.I.R Gallery titled,Dialectics of Isolation: An exhibition of Third World women artists in the United States,in 1980. The exhibition,WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution,at MOCA in 2007 led to critical attention, and her first major museum exhibition. The retrospective exhibition,Paper Like Skin,travelled from the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles (2012) to the Guggenheim, New York and the Art Institute of Chicago (2013).,Zarina’s works on paper, in print and collage, and her sculptures, made from paper pulp or metal, found homes in prominent museum collections such as the Tate Modern in London, the Metropolitan Museum, MoMA, Whitney and Guggenheim in New York. Her work is in many private collections and recent exhibitions have been held at the Kiran Nadar Museum in New Delhi (2020) and the Ishara Art Foundation in Dubai (2019).,It was in the poetics and yearnings of exile that she grounded her work, after the Partition and its upheaval fractured their lives in Aligarh, a world relentlessly yearned for; ‘Language ties my work together. Urdu is home’, and this included its capaciousness for metaphor and multiple meanings. ‘,Ghar,’ was always the floorplan of her father’s academic bungalow in Aligarh, described poignantly in,Letters from Home,2004.,In recent years, claiming that time was running out and that she wanted to use up all the scraps left in her studio, she had worked mostly with paper collage, referencing Faiz, Ghalib and Iqbal in the titles of inky starscapes, lines such as ‘,Akhri shab ke humsafar’,or,‘Sitaron se age jahan aur bhi hain’,.,Zarina departed on Saturday for the world beyond the stars, cared for and survived by her sister’s children in London.

"April 23, 2020 23:18 IST","NEW DELHI,","There is likely to be no respite from increases in the number of,COVID-19,cases and deaths in the country for at least three weeks, predicts a mathematical model that projects the future burden on India’s healthcare system. Based on the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and cases from several countries, the model posits that the country’s healthcare system must prepare to tend to 7,928 ICU patients on May 6. Authorities have currently extended the nationwide lockdown up to May 3. As of today India has 24,644 ICU beds and bed-demands and deaths, according to the model’s authors, assume a “worst-case” scenario.,Also read:,Indian scientists build model to estimate impact of interventions on COVID-19,The projections are available on a freely accessible website, covid19medinventory.in and the model has been developed by scientists spanning multiple institutions who were brought together by the office of the government’s Principal Scientific Advisor K. VijayRaghavan. The “academic initiative” as it describes itself bases its numbers on the number of COVID-19 deaths reported by hospitals. Though there are no projections on the number of cases, it derives numbers based on the global experience and relationships between testing and the true number of infections and, correlations such as: that 5% of total cases are critical, and 50% of those admitted to an ICU survive.,The website shows an India map with the expected number of positive cases in every district. The model itself, however, is yet to be peer-reviewed but is available as a preprint for perusal.,“Our model assumes a constant ratio between total infected (detected or not) and the number of deaths,” Aloke Kumar of the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, wrote in an e-mail reply to,The Hindu. “,So, any increase in deaths is reflected proportionately in confirmed cases. Since the entire model focuses on the healthcare system, we decided against giving out our projections for true infected in the dashboard,” he added. “Having said that, the death rate is approximately 1% of the estimate of true infection (considering South Korea as a benchmark where testing was quite methodical and extensive) and around 2-3% of reported infection.”,From April 23 to April 29, the model projects 1,164 deaths, and from April 29 to May 6 predicts the number of fatalities to rise to 3,964 — again the authors emphasise — based on a worst case scenario. As of Thursday, India had reported 21,700 cases and 686 deaths. “It is certainly a large jump, as shown by the model,” P. Sunthar, of the Chemical Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, wrote in an e-mail. “But we do hope the health administrations will take measures to contain the outbreak in badly affected areas (in which case we won’t see such large numbers in a week). But going by the global trend this is what the model shows,” he added.,While these numbers take into account the impact of the lockdown, the authors say the model’s projections for the third week and beyond aren’t yet reliable. Because it bases itself on deaths, the model would falter if the number of COVID-19 deaths aren’t truthfully recorded and could be a problem in rural areas or regions with limited hospitalisation facilities. However, being an adaptive model, the numbers as well as healthcare demand can change on a daily basis. Other scientists who participated in developing the model include those from the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, and personnel of the Armed Forces Medical Services.,Coronavirus | Expert View — how mathematical modelling can guide us forward | The Hindu In Focus Podcast","Coronavirus | Model shows deaths, cases rising over next three weeks"
